PROJECT: IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor,
and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their
measurements. Now, imagine that you have the measurements
of Iris flowers categorized by their respective species. Your
objective is to train a machine learning model that can learn from
these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into
their respective species.
Use the Iris dataset to develop a model that can classify iris
flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal
measurements. This dataset is widely used for introductory
classification tasks.

OVERVIWE OF THE PROJECT: Objective: Train a model to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on sepal and petal measurements.

Dataset: The Iris dataset includes 150 samples, each representing one of three species of iris flowers. There are four features in total:

Sepal length
Sepal width
Petal length
Petal width
Steps Involved:

Data Loading: Import the Iris dataset from sklearn or another source.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize the data to understand the relationships between features and species.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data, if needed, for modeling (e.g., handling missing values, scaling).
Model Selection: Choose a classification algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, or Support Vector Machine).
Model Training: Train the model using the dataset and split it into training and testing sets for validation.
Evaluation: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.
Optimization: Fine-tune the model using hyperparameter tuning or cross-validation.
